; The following start gcode will get you up and running in OrcaSlicer with two toolheads. Other slicers TBD. See notes on each line for details.

SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=[first_layer_bed_temperature] ; this sets the bed temperature to the first layer temperature as specified in your filament settings.
M190 S[first_layer_bed_temperature] ; this instructs the printer to wait until the bed temperature is reached.
T[initial_tool] ; this selects the initial tool used for the print just by paring the generic "T1", "T2", etc commands.
PRINT_START ; this starts your PRINT_START command, which should contain homing, bed mesh, nozzle cleaning, etc.
SET_HEATER_TEMPERATURE HEATER={if is_extruder_used[0]}extruder TARGET={first_layer_temperature[0]}{endif}{if is_extruder_used[1]}extruder1 TARGET={first_layer_temperature[1]}{endif} ; this is to set the extruder temperature. 
M109 S{if is_extruder_used[0]}{first_layer_temperature[0]}{endif}{if is_extruder_used[1]}extruder1{first_layer_temperature[1]}{endif} ; instructs the printer to wait for nozzle temp to be reached. 

; Note: If you use more than two toolheads, you will need to expand upon lines 7 and 8 above. And if you are using different names for your extruders (NOT your tools; they are different!), you'll need to change the names in the above example to fit.
; If you are only using two toolheads and have the same naming convention for your extruders as I do above, simply copy and paste lines 3-8 from here into your Start Gcode field in OrcaSlicer.
