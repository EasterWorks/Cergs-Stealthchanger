TBD - this document is to describe needed edits to printer.cfg and describe what other included CFG files do. also to list plugins needed like multi-fan, toolchanger, etc


When T0 does its initial homing routine and bed mesh at the start of a print, its nozzle offset is applied to the gantry. Meaning if the T0 offset is, say, -1.23, that will be the offset applied for the gantry as it is in motion during the print.

If T1 has a substantially different nozzle offset, say -0.23, this will result in the nozzle being shoved 1mm too far into the bed when T1 is switched to and begins printing. This can lead to stacking tolerance problems when printing parts with embedded color changes (for example: a black circle in the side of a square).
