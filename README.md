# Cergs-Stealthchanger

Repo status: PROTOTYPE (not ready for public use, stay tuned)  

This repo contains my configurations and settings for my Stealthchanger build.  

This repo may be useful for you if you are doing a Stealthchanger build on a Voron 2.4 or Trident and have the following considerations in mind:  

- You are using the LDO Nitehawk-SB, Nitehawk-36, or other USB toolhead instead of CANBUS.
- You are using the standard X/Y endstops that are located on the intersection of the X and Y axiis rather than the toolhead-mounted endstops or sensorless homing.
- You are using OptoTAP v2.4.1 for your Z axis probe and endstop trigger.
- You are currently digging through 5 different repos to find the right information and still can't get your setup to work.



In addition, I have edited and provided a few STL's that improve upon the original design and/or make it more suitable for the above considerations.  

This repo is under construction. I will update this document when it is in its "final" version (ie. a version where everything can be thrown together to create a working setup).  

If you have any questions about necessary plugins or part designs, please reach out to the original creators (whom will be listed and credited when their content is used).
