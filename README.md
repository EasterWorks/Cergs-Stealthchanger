# Cergs-Stealthchanger

Repo status: READY (ready for public reference)  

This repo contains my configurations and customizations for my Stealthchanger build.  

This repo may be useful to you if you have similar design constraints and requirements to my own:

- You have a 300mm Voron 2.4r2.
- Your mainboard in a BTT Octopus Pro or board with similar capabilities.
- You want to use Stealthburner toolheads with the E3D Revo hotend ecosystem.
- You are using LDO's Nitehawk-SB or Nitehawk-36 toolhead boards and Isik Tech's Birds' Nest for toolhead board networking.
- You are using the standard X/Y endstops that are located on the intersection of the X and Y axiis rather than the toolhead-mounted endstops or sensorless homing.
- You are using OptoTAP v2.4.1 for your Z axis probe and endstop trigger.
- You are me in the future and nuked your config files again.


In addition, I have edited and provided a few STL's that improve upon the original design and/or make it more suitable for the above considerations.  

This repo is under construction. The top line of this readme document says "Repo status" - I will keep this up to date as I update my progress on the toolchanger project.

If you have any questions about necessary plugins or part designs, please reach out to the original creators (whom will be listed and credited when their content is used). I also HIGHLY recommend joining the public Stealthchanger Discord channel, link here: https://discord.gg/kXuEYBsa


## How to Stealthchanger

I have created a guide in this repo that covers all the steps I took from day 1 to fully-functional. You can find it here: https://github.com/EasterWorks/Cergs-Stealthchanger/blob/main/Hardware-And-Calibration.md
