Explanation of STL files in this folder:


MGN12-shuttle.stl:
This is a replacement for the shuttle in the Stealthchanger repo that adds channels for excess belt pathing. The intention is that you will thread your belts around the "corner" and into the available channels as far as possible, then trim anything that sticks out of the sides. This both helps install the shuttle without juggling the belts and using strange methods to hold the belts in place and allows for the advisable retention of extra belt length just in case. Actual amount of Y axis travel loss TBD.



x-axis-prod.stl:
Both the default shuttle and my above redesign won't have sufficient width to hit the X axis limit switch without crashing into the gantry. This is a small plate that screws into the bottom of the above shuttle with two M3x8 SHCS screws and sticks out just enough to hit the trigger before the gantry crashes. Actual amount of X axis travel loss TBD.
