Current options allow for both Revo and Repido 2 hotends (credit to nicksnoopy on Discord for the Rapido 2 files). Uses 8x 6x3mm Neodymium magnets (recommend N52). Adhere to shaped cutouts using heat-tolerant superglue or epoxy (I find that Loctite Professional Liquid is sufficient for 50-60c chamber temps).
